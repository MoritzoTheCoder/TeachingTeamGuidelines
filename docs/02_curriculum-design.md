## Curriculum Design ##

In general, a course week consists of the following elements:

 - **Welcome Message**: A short text (Wiki Page) which gives an overview about the upcoming course week and leads to the next important course dates and assignment deadlines. 
 - **Videos and Self-Tests** (Quizzes): Videos and linked self-tests (quizzes) make up the main part of the course content. The clips shouldn’t extend a length of 10 minutes. Self-tests (quizzes) should take up and recap most important findings from the videos. (2-5-questions). 
 - **Additional readings**: at the end of a learning week (prior publishing the weekly assignments) a wiki page with links to additional readings is provided (Web-Links, PDF-documents, collected slides of the week, etc.)
 - **Weekly assignments** and Sample Solutions: last course-Item (at least in the duration of a course week) is the quiz which will make up the weekly assignment. In order to create the sample solution the textual explanation possibilities offered in the quiz system (either at question and answer level) should be used. If the publishing date of the sample solution is stated correctly, the publishing of the answers will be carried out automatically after the quiz deadline has passed.
 - (optional) not compulsory additional learning material: further videos, self-tests and pages with learning material can be added after the weekly assignments. But only if these don’t belong to the actual learnings relevant to the contents of the weekly assignments. It is important to highlight these facts on the relevant and welcome pages.
 - **Time Zone**: All times mentioned on the platforn are indicated in UTC. It is important to point this out to course participants.

Remarks:
The teaching team of the online course “Internetworking with TCP/ IP” used the web-based project management tool *Redmine* as well as a *shared Dropbox Folder* for inner team coordination and management of learning materials.
Dropbox was used for a quick exchange of data (graphics, slides, Pdf. etc.) and Redmine for tracking of shared tasks and the collective design (Wiki) of course content (especially the quizzes  and the text pages such as the “Welcome”, “Reading Material” and the “Sample Solution”). There is also a wiki-system available. If required, it is advised to contact the openHPI team.
If possible, Dropbox should be replaced by the HPI exchange platform Owncloud. For implementation, HPI’s Admin Team should be contacted.
In the process of adding Quizzes a user interface and a XML-importer is available. In case of using the XML-importer this should be discussed with Jan Renz, Thomas Staubitz or Christian Willems (openHPI-Team). For validating of XML data a XSD file is available. Also a google doc for collective editing is available. This can be exported into XML via Python.
